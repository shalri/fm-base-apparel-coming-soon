- Framer
- Prettier Tailwind Plugin
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I used NextJS for this challenge. Since I plan to integrate Frontend Mentor
into my study routine, I might as well play around with NextJS and React
alongside the challenges.

Implementing this challenge with NextJS made it more interesting. It gave me
a broader scope for learning.

I liked how I implemented some UX enhancements. The image will change saturation
based on the mouse movement.

This challenge also showed the importance of a `.fig` file. I spent most of
the time pixel-pushing to set the dimensions, spacing, and layout right.
I am proud of the results since I was only eyeballing it.

### Continued development

I look forward to doing more challenges from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
I like learning and practicing new concepts.
